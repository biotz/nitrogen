# Nitrogen

A platform for developing, testing, documenting and deploying a Python based (micro-)service with a REST API.

## Documentation

Nitrogen is creating two kind of documentation: technical documentation of the code, generated with the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and the [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/), a "language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection."
