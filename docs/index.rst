Nitrogen is a platform for developing, testing, documenting and deploying a Python based (micro-)service with a REST API. Meant to bond to the Hydrogen to provide additional functionality through a microservice architecture.

Problem space
-------------

In recent years Python has become one of the most popular programming languages. Simple syntax and a rich machine learning ecosystem makes it fairly easy to develop AI-powered services. But a low error rate model is not enough to be useful in a professional environment. The code needs to be well tested, documented and being deployable.

Solution
--------

The goal of this project is to tackle this challenge by creating a platform that empowers data scientists to create services that follow the best practices for software development. It does this by:
- Containerizing the application in Docker
- Encourages to follow the test driven development
- Running automatically tests on every file change
- Informing of the test coverage
- Generating documentation from the source file
- Requiring the developer to create a blueprint of the service
- Automatically creating a REST web service
- Creating an OpenAPI documentation for it.
